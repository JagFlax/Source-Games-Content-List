# What's listed
File paths of content used in Source Engine games. Materials and textures (.vmt and .vtf respectively), models (.mdl), and sounds (.wav and .mp3).

# How to use it
- Precache content in your server-side plugins or scripts.
- Create soundscape scripts for your maps.
- Spawn models via `prop_physics_create` or `prop_dynamic_create` console commands (requires `sv_cheats 1`).
- Play sounds in your game via the `play` console command.

# Why use this?
Right now there aren't many reasons to use this over the model/sound/texture browsers in [Hammer++](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Hammer%2B%2B) or Garry's Mod, especially since they can preview the assets.

Still, some people would prefer a minimalistic approach and bookmark the blobs in this repo.
